<!-- What does a designer do for my company? -->
<section class="container py-24 ">
    <h2>My design ethos</h2>
    <p>Communicate. Information. Visually.</p>
    <p>Being a graphic designer isn't about creating beautiful. Design serves a purpose. It has a goal and when reviewing a design it should only be assessed against that goal.</p>
    <p>A design has seconds to make an impression. If the purpose of the design isn't immediately apparent you've lost
        the chance to connect with most of your target audience.
        The hard truth is that almost everyone who looks at your company is going to glance at it. You need to make the
        absolute most of those few seconds.</p>
    <p>It's nearly impossible to meet this need with text alone</p>
    <p>Properly designed visuals impart tons of information at a glance. The moment you look at something you've already
        retained an impression about
    <ul>
        <li>What is the purpose, or message being relayed</li>
        <li>How does this relate to what I'm currently doing?</li>
        <li>Do I recognize this as being part of something else?</li>
        <li>Who is communicating this message</li>
    </ul>
    Not to mention next level intangibles like: 'How much effort was put into this'
    </p>
    <p>It's more important for your branding to be uniform than good</p>
    <p>Get the right people in the right places, give them the tools they need, provide them a safe environment to shine
        and let them get on with it.</p>

<!-- What am I looking for? -->
<section class="container my-24 ">
    <h2>What am I looking for?</h2>
    <p>In a nutshell I'm looking for opportunities where I can add the most value.</p>
    <p>Continuing to develop my skills across the board, this means working with people who are better than me.</p>
    <p>Somewhere that recognizes the advantages of an agile methodology: Having solid task tracking, with visibility and
        accountability. Or at the least are willing to put in the work implementing such a system.</p>
