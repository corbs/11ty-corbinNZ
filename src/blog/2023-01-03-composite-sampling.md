With fertili<%= I18n.t(:'t.s') %>er making up one of the biggest parts of the farm budget, it’s no wonder growers and service providers are doing more soil sampling to measure and understand soil nutrition. After all, how can you manage what you don’t measure? By having a good set of soil data, growers and service providers can collaborate on a cropping plan and prescriptions to optimi<%= I18n.t(:'t.s') %>e crop performance and get set up for a successful season.

At Agworld, we have been building on our sampling solution over the years to deliver an easier job management, soil collection and results process. Up until now samplers have been using grid and point sampling collection methods. But as a result of strong demand from customers globally over the last year, the Agworld development team has released the soil sampling feature that samplers have been waiting patiently for: composite sampling jobs!

Composite sampling jobs enable you to specify the exact locations of your sub sample points. Multiple sets of points can be created in the same job to accurately sample different zones or soil types within the same field.

Composite sampling jobs can be set up for the first year of sampling, and we’ve made sure that it’s easy for samplers to return to the same location next year to compare results year-on-year. That way when analy<%= I18n.t(:'t.s') %>ing results from soil sampling, growers and service providers have the right soil benchmarking information to optimi<%= I18n.t(:'t.s') %>e nutrition for a healthy crop.

On a similar topic, soil surface layers are now available on the Agworld map globally based on soil results uploaded or sent in via a lab. And the list of participating soil labs for automated sampling results in Agworld has grown massively over the past 12 months.
